#Introduction / About the Data

The City of Seattle recently bought out the bike-share service Pronto, which was established in 2014. The membership of the program has continued to see declines over the previous two years, resulting in the $1.4M buy-out acquisition by the city. In order to identify areas to improve the program the city is hoping to determine factors that define a good station in other bike-share programs, specifically the Capital City Bikeshare in the DC, MD, VA area. The exercise will require defining and collecting attributes that drive or are indicative of high-usage as measured by number of rentals.

<b><i> Sources of Data </b></i><br>
The data comes from four separate sources: [Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data), [Open Streetmap](http://osmar.r-forge.r-project.org/), [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro#Geocoding) and [NeighborhoodInfo](http://neighborhoodinfodc.org/index.html) (a collaborative composed of the Urban Institute and partner of the National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership (NNIP) ). 

From mapping the number of rentals we find that there is large distribution near the National Mall and reflecting pool, which also share proximity to a number of the national memorial monuments (Lincoln, Vietnam War, WWII and Korean War). Thus, it may be fairly likely that these sites contribute to our usage trends and deserve more exploration. 

Furthermore, we find in our table, that the majority of top rental stations occur in the warmer months, indicating weather influence on usage trends. In fact, on average, we find that there are more rentals in the warmer seasons across the entire data set.
